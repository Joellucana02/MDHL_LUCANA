          <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

          <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
              dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
              These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
              under 12 and older.
            </li>
            <li>
              COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program
              must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
              associations participating in the state competition program that
              are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
              requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
              assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
              the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
              be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are
              unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
              their games away.
            </li>
            <li>
              FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS a. U-6 play on a field
              approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for
              older age groups should be progressively larger. b. U-8 plays on a
              field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width. c. U-10 play on
              a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width. d. In
              addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
              dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

          <h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall
              play atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the
              competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of
              each game.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each
                  game under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences
                  from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice
                  and/or games, and injuries.
